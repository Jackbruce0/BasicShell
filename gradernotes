I wrote this code myself, but gained some inspiration from several sources.

Sources: - getword method was adapted from Foster's getchar example in inout2.c
           found in ~masc0000/CbyDiscovery/ch2/inout2.c
         - syntax and usage of execvp commmand was learned from exec1.c found
           in ~cs570/exec1.c
         - syntax and usage of fork command was learned from fork1.c found in 
           ~cs570/fork1.c
         - syntax and usage of getpid was learned from fork2.c found in
           ~cs570/fork2.c
         - loop for reaping child processes was adapted from lines 97-102 of
           pipe.c found in ~cs570/pipe.c
         - syntax and usage of dup2 was learned from dup2.c found in
           ~cs570/dup2.c
         - use of signals and a signal handler was learned from sig.c and 
           sighandler.c found in ~cs570/sig.c and ~cs570/sighandler.c
         - template for main method and parse was also followed from program 2
           instructions
         - http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html for reserved exit 
           codes
         - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-handling-c-programs/ for
           learning how to use 'errno' variable
         - man pages for dup2, execvp, getenv, chdir, exit, fork, open, perror,
           wait, stat, fflush, access, sigaction, signal, setpgid, getpgrp,
           and killpg

Design Decisions:
         - `[command] [>|<|>&] &` will write/read from/to a file named '&' if it
           meets standards for a valid file
            + as opposed to putting the command in the background with a 
              redirect pointing to an empty file
         - for `!!` I implemented a struct that saves the state of p2 and will
           load that previous state when `!!` is encountered
            + the use of a struct will make my life much easier when 
              implementing `history` in p4
         - handled error exit codes with errno variable
         - I used strdup for history and you said it was okay in an email

Known Deficiencies:
         - when a background process has printed output, it will print after the
           parent issued the prompt and the parent will not issue another
           prompt on a seperate line like tcsh does
            + performance is not hindered, shell is still activitely waiting
              for input
         - `make splint` prints unrecognized identifier warning for killpg. I
            could not figure out how to make this go away
